/**
 Safely dispatches the `action` onto our `Realm` queue.
 
 - Note: as of 7/22/2018, only write actions need to be safely dispatched. However, I have decided to take the approach of simply dispatching every action to this queue. This will simplify interactions with the `Realm`, and will also ensure that any retrieved data is the most up-to-date.
 
 - Parameters:
    - action: The action to perform.
    - realm: Our `Realm` instance.
